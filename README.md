This GitHub repository encompasses a multi-process server for a banking system, employing key operating system concepts. It facilitates client connections, supports account operations such as opening, crediting, debiting, and checking balances. It manages client connections and account operations while ensuring data integrity through shared memory and mutex locks. Socket communication facilitates client-server interactions. The system utilizes signal handlers for graceful termination and status display. OS topics involved include process management (forking), inter-process communication (shared memory), concurrency control (mutex locks), and signal handling.
